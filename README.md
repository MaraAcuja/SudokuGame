### 10 Functional Programming

Allover this project I tried to use as much as functional programming as possible. Below, there are some links to examples for the implementation:
1. Final data structures user_output.py
2. Side-effect-free functions user_output.py
3. Higher-order functions
4. Closured / anonymous functions
